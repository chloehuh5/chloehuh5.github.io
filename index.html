	<h2> A little bit about me... </h2>
	<h3> My name is Chloe Huh (pronounced "hugh") and I am a junior at Loyola Academy. I really like to take pictures and to read. In my free time I al usually with my friends/
		or on a run. I have a dog named Harry who I got when I was just 6 years old. Needless to say that he is now much bigger and older./
		As a kid I tried many sports unti I settles on oe i relly enjoyed. These included: basketball, softball, tennis, swimming, golf, waterpolo, horseback riding/
		soccer and running. I played soccer for many years and was on a competetive team when I decided to run competetively during high school. I now am on the cross/
		country and track team. </h3>
